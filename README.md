1. Legal  
“VR Funhouse: Christmas Edition uses Unreal® Engine. Unreal® is a trademark or registered trademark of Epic Games, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere.
Unreal® Engine, Copyright 1998 – 2020, Epic Games, Inc. All rights reserved.”  
  
  
2. Supported Devices  
This was developed for Steam VR on a Windows Mixed Reality device, the Samsung Odyssey+ HMD.  
I have included support for the HTC Vive and the Valve Index. I have not tested on these devices as I do not have access to them so if there are issues please let me know. Contact info is in the last section of this readme file.  
If you would like me to add support for another device, please email me and suggest what buttons should do what action. Grab button should grab but if there's no trackpad suggest another way to restart the level and exit the game.  
  
  
3. Descriptions  
A snowy, holiday themed virtual reality game that's all about interacting with the environment in an immersive way. Throw objects, smash presents, break a window. Heck destroy anything you can, you don't have to pay for it.  
VR Funhouse: Christmas Edition is a VR game (more like a demo) taking place at first in a wintry forest, and then in Grandma's living room. There are multiple types of objects to interact with in each level. It is scaled to work in a 10' x 10' area or larger.  
Credits are temporarily located in the GitHub repo. I will be listing them on my gaming website as well as in game soon.

4. To Run  
Either pay the couple dollars and download/install via Steam, or clone the source code from GitHub and package it yourself.  
  
  
5. Controls  
On Windows Mixed Reality Devices:  
- Grab/Pickup - Grip / Grab buttons (both controllers)  
- Restart Level - Right click on trackpad on right motion controller  
- Quit Game - Left click on trackpad on left motion controller
  
  
6. Known Bugs  
- Level 1, when throwing objects into Santa's house sometimes the thrown object will break window and hit all 3 colliders causing all 3 audio clips to play simultaneously.  
- Menus... There aren't any.  
- It's more of a failure to configure than it is a bug. If controllers don't grab, make sure it's a device listed in section 5 (above here), and if so it's a matter of SteamVR bindings. I put my headset on while in SteamVR and went into the menu and selected the option for controller bindings. I had to delete and reset the triggers to "GrabRight" and "GrabLeft", and followed by saving it as personal bindings. Then all worked well and I had wasted 3 days on a 5 minute fix.
  
  
7. Background  
Earlier this year I was a VR Programming intern at Dark Catt Studios in St. Charles. I would have been able to do some VR dev but I needed to complete my intern project beforehand.  
Unfortunately I was not allowed to work remotely and the internship was cut short due to COVID. In November I was approached about a VR job using Unreal Engine.  
I had VR experience in Unity and single player experience in Unreal. I needed to figure out how to make VR games in Unreal, and this is the result.  
After a month and a half of development and troubleshooting, the initial version is complete. I hope to add menus and splashscreens in the upcoming month, before resuming development on another game.
